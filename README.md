# ML-Assignment-3-Final-

Since my previous iteration, I went back and decided to use UserID as a feature instead of bag of words from the text. This gave me a better clustering result. 

I have run the model to iterate over the range of 2000 clusters. On the elbow graph, the 2000 clusters are performing the best, therefore I decided to use them.

This vast amount of clusters allows for more fine grouping of products. 

Based on the images below, the clustering of foods becomes more precise, where coffee and dog food and tea are clustered in separate categories, whereas before it would overlap.
